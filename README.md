# Front-End Lab

Front-End designs inspired from Dribbble made with pure HTML CSS & JavaScript.

<br />

# Why & How it helped me

I was fortunate to realise very early in my career that learning tools like HTML CSS or Js and making some buttons or forms work is merely not enough. One unleashes the true power of these tools only if one learns the core concepts of product design and development which eventually lead me to these experiments. Here I have tried cloning some pretty good designs from dribble. These exercises are completely made using Vanilla CSS without the help of any CSS frameworks.The skills I acquired during this process is invaluable and still comes in handy not just in my career but in every aspect of my life.<br/> <br/> <br/> And special thanks to [@jikkujose](https://github.com/jikkujose) for giving me the insights and mentoring me throughout these exercises.
